Simple a program that will ask the name, age, and height.

Outputs information back, in the format:
    Your name is __, you are ___ years old, and you are ___ high.

Extra credit, the program log this info in a file to be accessed later.

demos:
    reading input from command line.
    passing parameters as a list instead of individual vars.
    reading/writing to files.

To run: type "python3 filename.py"
